# UI/UX Rules

- **Terminology:** Use “Borrow (Check-out)” and “Return (Check-in)” everywhere.
- **Pages:** Must have loading states, empty states (“No books found”), and visible error states for API failures.
- **List page:** Search box, status filter, actions per row, confirmation modal on delete.
- **Badges:** Show AVAILABLE, BORROWED, OVERDUE.
- **Forms:** Display validation errors clearly and prevent invalid submissions.
