# Testing & Reliability

- After implementing each API route, do a basic manual test (curl or minimal UI call).
- Ensure no runtime errors on `npm run dev` and a clean build when possible.

# Commits (Workflow)

- Make logical checkpoints; ensure the project builds before each checkpoint:
  - Setup + Prisma schema + migration
  - API endpoints complete
  - UI pages complete
  - Bonus features (auth, AI, deploy)
- Keep commit messages short and descriptive.

# README (Mandatory)

- Must include: `npm install`, `prisma migrate`, `npm run dev`.
- Must mention Borrow/Return terminology.
- Include demo URL and demo credentials if auth is implemented and deployed.
